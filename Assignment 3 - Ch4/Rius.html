In this webpage, I have used external, embedded, and inline css! 
<br> </br> 
Additionally, I have decided to add two gifs as background images on my webpage.
<br> </br> 
This concept was learned in Ch. 8 and I decided to put a gif of the left of the page and another on the right of the page!
<br> </br>
I incorporated the two gifs be using "background-image: url" but since I have two gifs both were listed together.
<br> </br>
Additionally, the gif of Lebron used "background-position left" and the Cubs gif was placed on the right!
